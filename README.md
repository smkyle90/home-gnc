A home guidance, navigation and control repository.

Guidance: Configure points in your home and define a task that you wish to accomplish!

Navigation: Use Wifi Signal Strength to determine your location. You need to update the configuration parameters to suit your need.

Control: Tells you, a person, to move forward/back or left/right. This can be modified to calculate the controls for a modelled system.

The applications communicate using PyZMQ.

The graph optimisation is done using Graph Tool.

The state estimation needs root priviledges to access the relevant network information.

The controller uses a simple pole-placement technique.
